We used three algorithms Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic regression, and implemented them on the Heart Failure dataset and, recorded the results in this project. But we are comparing the results in Figures 4 and 5, we were able to analyze Naive Bayes and Decision Tree in-depth and record the best accuracy results for the dataset under evaluation, which were 85.0% and 94.0%, respectively.
